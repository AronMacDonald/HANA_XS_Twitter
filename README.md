HANA XS Twitter Example




Small Warning:  The code that I have loaded on GitHub works in my environment but is still in true ‘prototype state’ and is not production ready,  has no error handling and has not been stress tested with high volumes of data.


insertTweet.xsjs is the HANA XS Serverside Java script
tweets_create.sql is the sql statement to create the table in HANA
